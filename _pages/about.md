I am a senior student in Computer Science at [Gwangju Institute of science and technology](https://www.gist.ac.kr/) and a part of GIST AI Data Science lab.

I am interested in machine learning deep learning. In the past, I did research on Visual Place Recognition. Currently, research on [Abstraction and Reasoning challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge) is in progress.
